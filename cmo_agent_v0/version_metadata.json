    {
      "layer": "research",
      "reason": "To improve timeliness, added emphasis on 'most current and rapidly evolving', 'real-time or very recent trending topics', 'within the last 24-48 hours', and prioritizing up-to-the-minute data sources. Also added 'trend_recency' to the output structure for explicit reporting.",
      "expected_impact": "The Research layer will focus more intensely on very recent trends, providing more timely input to subsequent layers, which should positively impact the overall relevance and potential virality of content."
    },
    {
      "layer": "creative_writer",
      "reason": "To boost engagement potential, added stronger directives like 'intensely engaging', 'maximum engagement potential', and 'compels immediate interaction'. Emphasized considering factors that make content 'resonate enough to share', 'spark conversations or debates', and 'encourage direct engagement' (questions, polls, user stories).",
      "expected_impact": "Content ideas from this layer will be inherently more designed for interaction and sharing, leading to higher engagement scores in subsequent evaluations."
    },
    {
      "layer": "generator",
      "reason": "To critically improve shareability, the prompt now explicitly emphasizes 'exceptionally shareable', 'primary emphasis MUST be on maximizing shareability'. Detailed instructions are added for text impact, irresistible hooks, emotional appeals/value, and a vivid, shareability-enhancing `media_prompt`. The call to action is strengthened to encourage retweets/quote tweets, and the instruction to create content people 'feel compelled to reshare' is added.",
      "expected_impact": "This layer will produce content highly optimized for sharing, directly addressing the low shareability metric and contributing to a higher overall engagement rate."
